# boundary-layer-code
This repository serves as a collaborative space for code generated during interactive sessions between Scott Quick and Grok (built by xAI). It focuses on computational examples, toy models, and simulations inspired by the Boundary Layer Thesis (v12), a speculative framework unifying Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity. The thesis is available on Figshare at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.29552936.v1.
What the Project Does
The repo collects and organizes Python code snippets, scripts, and notebooks from our sessions. These include:
	•	Numerical examples (e.g., entanglement entropy calculations like SA =3c ln(ϵL )+S0  from thesis page 4-5).
	•	Toy models for holographic principles, entropic gravity, and quantum error correction (e.g., based on Ryu-Takayanagi formula on page 4).
	•	Simulations exploring emergent phenomena, such as gravity from quantum frames (referencing thesis sections 2.1-2.3).
Code is executed in a stateful REPL environment with libraries like NumPy, SciPy, SymPy, and Matplotlib.
Why the Project is Useful
It provides executable insights into the Boundary Layer Thesis, making abstract concepts testable and iterable. Users can:
	•	Reproduce thesis predictions (e.g., gravitational wave deviations on page 11).
	•	Experiment with modifications to models.
	•	Contribute to refining the thesis through code-based explorations, bridging theory and computation.
This aids researchers, students, or enthusiasts in quantum gravity and holography.
How Users Can Get Started
	1	Clone the Repo: Use git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Grok-BoundaryLayer-Code.git (replace with actual URL).
	2	Set Up Environment: Install Python 3.12+ and required libraries via pip install -r requirements.txt (if provided; otherwise, core libs: numpy, scipy, sympy, matplotlib).
	3	Run Code: Open a script (e.g., in /code_sessions/session_2025-07-14_entropy.py) in your IDE or Jupyter Notebook and execute. Start with simple examples tied to thesis pages.
	4	Contribute: Fork the repo, add your code in a new branch, and submit a pull request with references to the thesis.
Where Users Can Get Help
	•	Issues Tab: Open a GitHub issue for bugs, questions, or suggestions.
	•	Discussions: Use GitHub Discussions for thesis-related queries.
	•	Thesis Reference: Consult the full v12 PDF on Figshare for context.
	•	Contact: Reach out via GitHub or scott.quick@lucidhub.com
Who Maintains and Contributes
	•	Maintainer: Scott Quick (primary collaborator and thesis author).
	•	Contributor: Grok (xAI), generating code during sessions.
	•	Open to contributions from the community—see CONTRIBUTING.md for guidelines.
